## Usage
Replit.Uptimer can be used in your Replit projects to monitor their uptime and automatically create an API. Here is an example of how to use it:
```javascript
import { UptimeNow } from "replit.uptimer";
/*
 //CJS
 const { UptimeNow } = require("replit.uptimer")
*/

UptimeNow();
```
### Preload
-   If you do this, you do not need to write a callback, the package will be called in advance
```sh
node -r replit.uptimer/start index.js
```
### Here's an example of a .replit file. Modify it to this content.
- .replit
```sh
run = "node -r replit.uptimer/start index.js"

[nix]
channel = "stable-22_11"
```

## Note
By default, replit.uptimer will monitor the project's uptime every 50 seconds and create an API that returns a JSON object with the project's title, description, and URL. You can customize the configuration by creating a `uptime.config.json` file in your project's root directory. Here is an example of the default configuration:

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "create_api": true,
  "port": 3000,
  "path": "/"
}
```
You can modify any of these properties to customize the behavior of replit.uptimer.
